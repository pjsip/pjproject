/**

 * @{
 *
 * This is is a transport-independent object to manage a client or server 
 * STUN session. It has the following features:
 * 
 *  - <b>transport independent</b>:\n
 *    the object does not have it's own socket, but rather it provides
 *    functions and callbacks to send and receive packets. This way the
 *    object can be used by different transport types (e.g. UDP, TCP, 
 *    TLS, etc.) as well as better integration to application which
 *    already has its own means to send and receive packets.
 * 
 *  - <b>authentication management</b>:\n
 *    the object manages STUN authentication throughout the lifetime of
 *    the session. For client sessions, once it's given a credential to
 *    authenticate itself with the server, the object will automatically
 *    add authentication info (the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY) to the request as
 *    well as authenticate the response. It will also handle long-term 
 *    authentication challenges, including handling of nonce expiration,
 *    and retry the request automatically. For server sessions, it can 
 *    be configured to authenticate incoming requests automatically.
 *  
 *  - <b>static or dynamic credential</b>:\n
 *    application may specify static or dynamic credential to be used by
 *    the STUN session. Static credential means a static combination of
 *    username and password (and these cannot change during the session
 *    duration), while dynamic credential provides callback to ask the
 *    application about which username/password to use everytime
 *    authentication is about to be performed.
 *    
 *  - <b>client transaction management</b>:\n
 *    outgoing requests may be sent with a STUN transaction for reliability,
 *    and the object will manage the transaction internally (including
 *    performing retransmissions). Application will be notified about the
 *    result of the request when the response arrives (or the transaction
 *    times out). When the request is challenged with authentication, the
 *    object will retry the request with new authentication info, and 
 *    application will be notified about the final result of this request.
 * 
 *  - <b>server transaction management</b>:\n
 *    application may ask response to incoming requests to be cached by
 *    the object, and in this case the object will check for cached
 *    response everytime request is received. The cached response will be
 *    deleted once a timer expires.
 *
 * \section using_stun_sess_sec Using the STUN session
 *
 * The following steps describes how to use the STUN session:
 *
 *  - <b>create the object configuration</b>:\n
 *    The #pj_stun_config contains the configuration to create the STUN
 *    session, such as the timer heap to register internal timers and
 *    various STUN timeout values. You can initialize this structure by
 *    calling #pj_stun_config_init()
 *
 *  - <b>create the STUN session</b>:\n
 *    by calling #pj_stun_session_create(). Among other things, this
 *    function requires the instance of #pj_stun_config and also 
 *    #pj_stun_session_cb structure which stores callbacks to send
 *    outgoing packets as well as to notify application about incoming
 *    STUN requests, responses, and indicates and other events.
 *
 *  - <b>configure credential:</b>\n
 *    if authentication is required for the session, configure the
 *    credential with #pj_stun_session_set_credential()
 *
 *  - <b>configuring other settings:</b>\n
 *    several APIs are provided to configure the behavior of the STUN
 *    session (for example, to set the SOFTWARE attribute value, controls
 *    the logging behavior, fine tune the mutex locking, etc.). Please see
 *    the API reference for more info.
 *
 *  - <b>creating outgoing STUN requests or indications:</b>\n
 *    create the STUN message by using #pj_stun_session_create_req() or
 *    #pj_stun_session_create_ind(). This will create a transmit data
 *    buffer containing a blank STUN request or indication. You will then
 *    typically need to add STUN attributes that are relevant to the
 *    request or indication, but note that some default attributes will
 *    be added by the session later when the message is sent (such as
 *    SOFTWARE attribute and attributes related to authentication).
 *    The message is now ready to be sent.
 *
 *  - <b>sending outgoing message:</b>\n
 *    use #pj_stun_session_send_msg() to send outgoing STUN messages (this
 *    includes STUN requests, indications, and responses). The function has
 *    options whether to retransmit the request (for non reliable transports)
 *    or to cache the response if we're sending response. This function in 
 *    turn will call the \a on_send_msg() callback of #pj_stun_session_cb 
 *    to request the application to send the packet.
 *
 *  - <b>handling incoming packet:</b>\n
 *    call #pj_stun_session_on_rx_pkt() everytime the application receives
 *    a STUN packet. This function will decode the packet and process the
 *    packet according to the message, and normally this will cause one
 *    of the callback in the #pj_stun_session_cb to be called to notify
 *    the application about the event.
 *
 *  - <b>handling incoming requests:</b>\n
 *    incoming requests are notified to application in the \a on_rx_request
 *    callback of the #pj_stun_session_cb. If authentication is enabled in
 *    the session, the application will only receive this callback after
 *    the incoming request has been authenticated (if the authentication
 *    fails, the session would respond automatically with 401 error and
 *    the callback will not be called). Application now must create and
 *    send response for this request.
 *
 *  - <b>creating and sending response:</b>\n
 *    create the STUN response with #pj_stun_session_create_res(). This will
 *    create a transmit data buffer containing a blank STUN response. You 
 *    will then typically need to add STUN attributes that are relevant to
 *    the response, but note that some default attributes will
 *    be added by the session later when the message is sent (such as
 *    SOFTWARE attribute and attributes related to authentication).
 *    The message is now ready to be sent. Use #pj_stun_session_send_msg()
 *    (as explained above) to send the response.
 *
 *  - <b>convenient way to send response:</b>\n
 *    the #pj_stun_session_respond() is provided as a convenient way to
 *    create and send simple STUN responses, such as error responses.
 *    
 *  - <b>destroying the session:</b>\n
 *    once the session is done, use #pj_stun_session_destroy() to destroy
 *    the session.
