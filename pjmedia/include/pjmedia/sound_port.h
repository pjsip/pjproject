/**

 * @ingroup PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK
 * @brief Media Port Connection Abstraction to the Sound Device
 @{

 As explained in @ref PJMED_SND, the sound hardware abstraction provides
 some callbacks for its user:
 - it calls <b><tt>rec_cb</tt></b> callback when it has finished capturing
   one media frame, and 
 - it calls <b><tt>play_cb</tt></b> when it needs media frame to be 
   played to the sound playback hardware.

 The @ref PJMED_SND_PORT (the object being explained here) add a
 thin wrapper to the hardware abstraction:
 - it will call downstream port's <tt>put_frame()</tt>
   when <b><tt>rec_cb()</tt></b> is called (i.e. when the sound hardware 
   has finished capturing frame), and 
 - it will call downstream port's <tt>get_frame()</tt> when 
   <b><tt>play_cb()</tt></b> is called (i.e. every time the 
   sound hardware needs more frames to be played to the playback hardware).

 This simple abstraction enables media to flow automatically (and
 in timely manner) from the downstream media port to the sound device.
 In other words, the sound device port supplies media clock to
 the ports. The media clock concept is explained in @ref PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK
 section.

 Application registers downstream port to the sound device port by
 calling #pjmedia_snd_port_connect();
