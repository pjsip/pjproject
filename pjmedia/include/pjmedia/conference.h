/**
 * Create conference bridge with the specified parameters. The sampling rate,
 * samples per frame, and bits per sample will be used for the internal
 * operation of the bridge (e.g. when mixing audio frames). However, ports 
 * with different configuration may be connected to the bridge. In this case,
 * the bridge is able to perform sampling rate conversion, and buffering in 
 * case the samples per frame is different.
 *
 * For this version of PJMEDIA, only 16bits per sample is supported.
 *
 * For this version of PJMEDIA, the channel count of the ports MUST match
 * the channel count of the bridge.
 *
 * Under normal operation (i.e. when PJMEDIA_CONF_NO_DEVICE option is NOT
 * specified), the bridge internally create an instance of sound device
 * and connect the sound device to port zero of the bridge. 
 *
 * If PJMEDIA_CONF_NO_DEVICE options is specified, no sound device will
 * be created in the conference bridge. Application MUST acquire the port
 * interface of the bridge by calling #pjmedia_conf_get_master_port(), and
 * connect this port interface to a sound device port by calling
 * #pjmedia_snd_port_connect(), or to a master port (pjmedia_master_port)
 * if application doesn't want to instantiate any sound devices.
 *
 * The sound device or master port are crucial for the bridge's operation, 
 * because it provides the bridge with necessary clock to process the audio
 * frames periodically. Internally, the bridge runs when get_frame() to 
 * port zero is called.
 *
 * @param pool		    Pool to use to allocate the bridge and 
 *			    additional buffers for the sound device.
 * @param max_slots	    Maximum number of slots/ports to be created in
 *			    the bridge. Note that the bridge internally uses
 *			    one port for the sound device, so the actual 
 *			    maximum number of ports will be less one than
 *			    this value.
 * @param sampling_rate	    Set the sampling rate of the bridge. This value
 *			    is also used to set the sampling rate of the
 *			    sound device.
 * @param channel_count	    Number of channels in the PCM stream. Normally
 *			    the value will be 1 for mono, but application may
 *			    specify a value of 2 for stereo. Note that all
 *			    ports that will be connected to the bridge MUST 
 *			    have the same number of channels as the bridge.
 * @param samples_per_frame Set the number of samples per frame. This value
 *			    is also used to set the sound device.
 * @param bits_per_sample   Set the number of bits per sample. This value
 *			    is also used to set the sound device. Currently
 *			    only 16bit per sample is supported.
 * @param options	    Bitmask options to be set for the bridge. The
 *			    options are constructed from #pjmedia_conf_option
 *			    enumeration.
 * @param p_conf	    Pointer to receive the conference bridge instance.
