 * @{
 *
 * This section describes media port to split and combine media
 * channels in the stream.
 *
 * A splitter/combiner splits a single stereo/multichannels audio frame into
 * multiple audio frames to each channel when put_frame() is called, 
 * and combines mono frames from each channel into a stereo/multichannel 
 * frame when get_frame() is called. A common application for the splitter/
 * combiner is to split frames from stereo to mono and vise versa.

 * The same process happens when application calls put_frame() to the
