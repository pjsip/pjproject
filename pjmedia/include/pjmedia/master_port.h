 * @brief Thread based media clock provider
 * @{
 *
 * A master port has two media ports connected to it, and by convention
 * thay are called downstream and upstream ports. The media stream flowing to
 * the downstream port is called encoding or send direction, and media stream 
 * flowing to the upstream port is called decoding or receive direction
 * (imagine the downstream as stream to remote endpoint, and upstream as
 * local media port; media flowing to remote endpoint (downstream) will need
 * to be encoded before it is transmitted to remote endpoint).
 *
 * A master port internally has an instance of @ref PJMEDIA_CLOCK, which
 * provides the essensial timing for the master port. The @ref PJMEDIA_CLOCK
 * runs asynchronously, and whenever a clock <b>tick</b> expires, a callback
 * will be called, and the master port performs the following tasks:
 *  - it calls <b><tt>get_frame()</tt></b> from the downstream port,
 *    when give the frame to the upstream port by calling <b><tt>put_frame
 *    </tt></b> to the upstream port, and
 *  - performs the same task, but on the reverse direction (i.e. get the stream
 *    from upstream port and give it to the downstream port).
 *
 * Because master port enables media stream to flow automatically, it is
 * said that the master port supplies @ref PJMEDIA_PORT_CLOCK to the 
 * media ports interconnection.
