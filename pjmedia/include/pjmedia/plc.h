 * @{
 *
 * This section describes PJMEDIA's implementation of Packet Lost
 * Concealment algorithm. This algorithm is used to implement PLC for
 * codecs that do not have built-in support for one (e.g. G.711 or GSM 
 * codecs).
 *
 * The PLC algorithm (either built-in or external) is embedded in
 * PJMEDIA codec instance, and application can conceal lost frames
 * by calling <b><tt>recover()</tt></b> member of the codec's member
 * operation (#pjmedia_codec_op).
 *
 * See also @ref plc_codec for more info.
