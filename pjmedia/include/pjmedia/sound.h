/**
 * @defgroup PJMED_SND Portable Sound Hardware Abstraction
 * @ingroup PJMED_SND_PORT
 * @brief PJMEDIA abstraction for sound device hardware
 * @{
 *
 * <strong>Warning: this sound device API has been deprecated
 * and replaced by PJMEDIA Audio Device API. Please see
 * http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/Audio_Dev_API for more
 * information.</strong>
 *
 * This section describes lower level abstraction for sound device
 * hardware. Application normally uses the higher layer @ref
 * PJMED_SND_PORT abstraction since it works seamlessly with 
 * @ref PJMEDIA_PORT.
 *
 * The sound hardware abstraction basically runs <b>asychronously</b>,
 * and application must register callbacks to be called to receive/
 * supply audio frames from/to the sound hardware.
 *
 * A full duplex sound stream (created with #pjmedia_snd_open()) 
 * requires application to supply two callbacks:
 *  - <b><tt>rec_cb</tt></b> callback to be called when it has finished
 *    capturing one media frame, and 
 *  - <b><tt>play_cb</tt></b> callback to be called when it needs media 
 *    frame to be played to the sound playback hardware.
 *
 * Half duplex sound stream (created with #pjmedia_snd_open_rec() or
 * #pjmedia_snd_open_player()) will only need one of the callback to
 * be specified.
 *
 * After sound stream is created, application need to call
 * #pjmedia_snd_stream_start() to start capturing/playing back media
 * frames from/to the sound device.
