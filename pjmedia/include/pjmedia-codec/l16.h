 *
 * This section describes functions to initialize and register L16 codec
 * factory to the codec manager. After the codec factory has been registered,
 * application can use @ref PJMEDIA_CODEC API to manipulate the codec.
 *
 * Note that the L16 codec factory registers several (about fourteen!) 
 * L16 codec types to codec manager (different combinations of clock
 * rate and number of channels).

 *
 * \subsection l16_general_setting General Settings
 *
 * General codec settings for this codec such as VAD and PLC can be 
 * manipulated through the <tt>setting</tt> field in #pjmedia_codec_param. 
 * Please see the documentation of #pjmedia_codec_param for more info.
