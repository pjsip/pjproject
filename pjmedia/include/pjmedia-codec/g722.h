 * @brief Implementation of G.722 Codec
 * @{
 *
 * This section describes functions to initialize and register G.722 codec
 * factory to the codec manager. After the codec factory has been registered,
 * application can use @ref PJMEDIA_CODEC API to manipulate the codec.
 *
 * The G.722 implementation uses 16-bit PCM with sampling rate 16000Hz and 
 * 20ms frame length resulting in 64kbps bitrate.
 *
 * The G.722 codec implementation is provided as part of pjmedia-codec
 * library, and does not depend on external G.722 codec implementation.
 *
 * \section codec_g722_setting Codec Settings
 *
 * \subsection g722_general_setting General Settings
 *
 * General codec settings for this codec such as VAD and PLC can be 
 * manipulated through the <tt>setting</tt> field in #pjmedia_codec_param. 
 * Please see the documentation of #pjmedia_codec_param for more info.
 *
 * \subsection g722_specific_setting Codec Specific Settings
 *
 * Currently none.
