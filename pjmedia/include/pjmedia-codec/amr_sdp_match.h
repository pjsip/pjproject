/* Match AMR-NB and AMR-WB format in the SDP media offer and answer. This
 * function will match some AMR settings in the SDP format parameters, i.e:
 * octet-align, crc, robust-sorting, interleaving. Note that, for answerer,

 * should set #PJMEDIA_SDP_NEG_FMT_MATCH_ALLOW_MODIFY_ANSWER in the option.
 *
 * @param pool          The memory pool.
 * @param offer         The SDP media offer.
 * @param o_fmt_idx     Index of the AMR format in the SDP media offer.
 * @param answer        The SDP media answer.
 * @param a_fmt_idx     Index of the AMR format in the SDP media answer.
 * @param option        The format matching option, see
 *                      #pjmedia_sdp_neg_fmt_match_flag.
 *
 * @return              PJ_SUCCESS when the formats in offer and answer match.
