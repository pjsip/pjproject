/**

 * @ingroup PJ_POOL_GROUP
 * @brief Stack/buffer based pool.
 *
 * This section describes an implementation of memory pool which uses
 * memory allocated from the stack. Application creates this pool
 * by specifying a buffer (which can be allocated from static memory or
 * stack variable), and then use normal pool API to access/use the pool.
 *
 * If the buffer specified during pool creation is a buffer located in the
 * stack, the pool will be invalidated (or implicitly destroyed) when the
 * execution leaves the enclosing block containing the buffer. Note
 * that application must make sure that any objects allocated from this
 * pool (such as mutexes) have been destroyed before the pool gets
 * invalidated.
 *
 * Sample usage:
 *
 * \code
  #include <pjlib.h>

  static void test()
  {
    char buffer[500];
    pj_pool_t *pool;
    void *p;

    pool = pj_pool_create_on_buf("thepool", buffer, sizeof(buffer));

    // Use the pool as usual
    p = pj_pool_alloc(pool, ...);
    ...

    // No need to release the pool
  }

  int main()
  {
    pj_init();
    test();
    return 0;
  }

   \endcode
