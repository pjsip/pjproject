 *
 * Atomic queue for a single consumer and producer.
 * This cyclic queue employs a ring buffer for storage, maintaining read/write
 * pointers without locks. Itâ€™s designed for one producer and one consumer,
 * as having multiple producers/consumers could lead to conflicts with the
 * read/write pointers.
 * The producer uses #pj_atomic_queue_put() to add an item to the back
 * of the queue, while the consumer uses #pj_atomic_queue_get()
 * to retrieve an item from the front.
