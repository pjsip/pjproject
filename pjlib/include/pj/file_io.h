 * file API or ANSI stream. 
 *
 * @section pj_file_size_limit_sec Size Limits
 *
 * There may be limitation on the size that can be handled by the
 * #pj_file_setpos() or #pj_file_getpos() functions. The API itself
 * uses 64-bit integer for the file offset/position (where available); 
 * however some backends (such as ANSI) may only support signed 32-bit 
 * offset resolution.
 *
 * Reading and writing operation uses signed 32-bit integer to indicate
 * the size.
