/**
 * @defgroup PJ_IOQUEUE IOQueue: I/O Event Dispatching with Proactor Pattern
 * @ingroup PJ_IO
 * @{
 *
 * I/O Queue provides API for performing asynchronous I/O operations. It
 * conforms to proactor pattern, which allows application to submit an
 * asynchronous operation and to be notified later when the operation has
 * completed.
 *
 * The I/O Queue can work on both socket and file descriptors. For 
 * asynchronous file operations however, one must make sure that the correct
 * file I/O back-end is used, because not all file I/O back-end can be
 * used with the ioqueue. Please see \ref PJ_FILE_IO for more details.
 *
 * The framework works natively in platforms where asynchronous operation API
 * exists, such as in Windows NT with IoCompletionPort/IOCP. In other 
 * platforms, the I/O queue abstracts the operating system's event poll API
 * to provide semantics similar to IoCompletionPort with minimal penalties
 * (i.e. per ioqueue and per handle mutex protection).
 *
 * The I/O queue provides more than just unified abstraction. It also:
 *  - makes sure that the operation uses the most effective way to utilize
 *    the underlying mechanism, to achieve the maximum theoritical
 *    throughput possible on a given platform.
 *  - choose the most efficient mechanism for event polling on a given
 *    platform.
 *
 * Currently, the I/O Queue is implemented using:
 *  - <tt><b>select()</b></tt>, as the common denominator, but the least 
 *    efficient. Also the number of descriptor is limited to 
 *    \c PJ_IOQUEUE_MAX_HANDLES (which by default is 64).
 *  - <tt><b>/dev/epoll</b></tt> on Linux (user mode and kernel mode), 
 *    a much faster replacement for select() on Linux (and more importantly
 *    doesn't have limitation on number of descriptors).
 *  - <b>I/O Completion ports</b> on Windows NT/2000/XP, which is the most 
 *    efficient way to dispatch events in Windows NT based OSes, and most 
 *    importantly, it doesn't have the limit on how many handles to monitor.
 *    And it works with files (not only sockets) as well.
 *
 *
 * \section pj_ioqueue_concurrency_sec Concurrency Rules
 *
 * The ioqueue has been fine tuned to allow multiple threads to poll the
 * handles simultaneously, to maximize scalability when the application is
 * running on multiprocessor systems. When more than one threads are polling
 * the ioqueue and there are more than one handles are signaled, more than
 * one threads will execute the callback simultaneously to serve the events.
 * These parallel executions are completely safe when the events happen for
 * two different handles.
 *
 * However, with multithreading, care must be taken when multiple events 
 * happen on the same handle, or when event is happening on a handle (and 
 * the callback is being executed) and application is performing 
 * unregistration to the handle at the same time.
 *
 * The treatments of above scenario differ according to the concurrency
 * setting that are applied to the handle.
 *
 * \subsection pj_ioq_concur_set Concurrency Settings for Handles
 *
 * Concurrency can be set on per handle (key) basis, by using
 * #pj_ioqueue_set_concurrency() function. The default key concurrency value 
 * for the handle is inherited from the key concurrency setting of the ioqueue, 
 * and the key concurrency setting for the ioqueue can be changed by using
 * #pj_ioqueue_set_default_concurrency(). The default key concurrency setting 
 * for ioqueue itself is controlled by compile time setting
 * PJ_IOQUEUE_DEFAULT_ALLOW_CONCURRENCY.
 *
 * Note that this key concurrency setting only controls whether multiple
 * threads are allowed to operate <b>on the same key</b> at the same time. 
 * The ioqueue itself always allows multiple threads to enter the ioqeuue at 
 * the same time, and also simultaneous callback calls to <b>differrent 
 * keys</b> is always allowed regardless to the key concurrency setting.
 *
 * \subsection pj_ioq_parallel Parallel Callback Executions for the Same Handle
 *
 * Note that when key concurrency is enabled (i.e. parallel callback calls on
 * the same key is allowed; this is the default setting), the ioqueue will only
 * perform simultaneous callback executions on the same key when the key has
 * invoked multiple pending operations. This could be done for example by
 * calling #pj_ioqueue_recvfrom() more than once on the same key, each with
 * the same key but different operation key (pj_ioqueue_op_key_t). With this
 * scenario, when multiple packets arrive on the key at the same time, more
 * than one threads may execute the callback simultaneously, each with the
 * same key but different operation key.
 *
 * When there is only one pending operation on the key (e.g. there is only one
 * #pj_ioqueue_recvfrom() invoked on the key), then events occuring to the
 * same key will be queued by the ioqueue, thus no simultaneous callback calls
 * will be performed.
 *
 * \subsection pj_ioq_allow_concur Concurrency is Enabled (Default Value)
 *
 * The default setting for the ioqueue is to allow multiple threads to
 * execute callbacks for the same handle/key. This setting is selected to
 * promote good performance and scalability for application.
 *
 * However this setting has a major drawback with regard to synchronization,
 * and application MUST carefully follow the following guidelines to ensure 
 * that parallel access to the key does not cause problems:
 *
 *  - Always note that callback may be called simultaneously for the same
 *    key.
 *  - <b>Care must be taken when unregistering a key</b> from the
 *    ioqueue. Application must take care that when one thread is issuing
 *    an unregistration, other thread is not simultaneously invoking the
 *    callback <b>to the same key</b>.
 *\n
 *    This happens because the ioqueue functions are working with a pointer
 *    to the key, and there is a possible race condition where the pointer
 *    has been rendered invalid by other threads before the ioqueue has a
 *    chance to acquire mutex on it.
 *
 * \subsection pj_ioq_disallow_concur Concurrency is Disabled
 *
 * Alternatively, application may disable key concurrency to make 
 * synchronization easier. As noted above, there are three ways to control
 * key concurrency setting:
 *  - by controlling on per handle/key basis, with #pj_ioqueue_set_concurrency().
 *  - by changing default key concurrency setting on the ioqueue, with
 *    #pj_ioqueue_set_default_concurrency().
 *  - by changing the default concurrency on compile time, by declaring
 *    PJ_IOQUEUE_DEFAULT_ALLOW_CONCURRENCY macro to zero in your config_site.h
