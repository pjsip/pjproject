 * \section PJ_DNS_SRV_RESOLVER_INTRO DNS SRV Resolution Helper
 *
 * This module provides an even higher layer of abstraction for the DNS
 * resolution framework, to resolve DNS SRV names.
 *
 * The #pj_dns_srv_resolve() function will asynchronously resolve the server
 * name into IP address(es) with a single function call. If the SRV name
 * contains multiple names, then each will be resolved with individual
 * DNS A resolution to get the IP addresses. Upon successful completion, 
 * application callback will be called with each IP address of the
 * target selected based on the load-balancing and fail-over criteria
 * below.
 *
 * When the resolver fails to resolve the name using DNS SRV resolution
 * (for example when the DNS SRV record is not present in the DNS server),
 * the resolver will fallback to using DNS A record resolution to resolve
 * the name.
 *
 * \subsection PJ_DNS_SRV_RESOLVER_FAILOVER_LOADBALANCE Load-Balancing and Fail-Over
 *
 * When multiple targets are returned in the DNS SRV response, server entries
 * are selected based on the following rule (which is described in RFC 2782):
 *  - targets will be sorted based on the priority first.
 *  - for targets with the same priority, #pj_dns_srv_resolve() will select
 *    only one target according to its weight. To select this one target,
 *    the function associates running-sum for all targets, and generates 
 *    a random number between zero and the total running-sum (inclusive).
 *    The target selected is the first target with running-sum greater than
 *    or equal to this random number.
 *
 * The above procedure will select one target for each priority, allowing
 * application to fail-over to the next target when the previous target fails.
 * These targets are returned in the #pj_dns_srv_record structure 
 * argument of the callback. 
 *
 * \section PJ_DNS_SRV_RESOLVER_REFERENCE Reference
