/**

 * @brief Provides INVITE session management.
 * @{
 *
 * The INVITE session uses the @ref PJSIP_DIALOG framework to manage
 * the underlying dialog, and is one type of usages that can use
 * a particular dialog instance (other usages are event subscription,
 * discussed in @ref PJSIP_EVENT_NOT). The INVITE session manages
 * the life-time of the session, and also manages the SDP negotiation.
 *
 * Application must link with  <b>pjsip-ua</b> static library to use this API.
 *
 * More detailed information is explained in
 * <A HREF="/docs.htm">PJSIP Developer's Guide</A>
 * PDF document, and readers are encouraged to read the document to
 * get the concept behind dialog, dialog usages, and INVITE sessions.
 *
 * The INVITE session does NOT manage media. If application wants to
 * use API that encapsulates both signaling and media in a very easy
 * to use API, it can use @ref PJSUA_LIB for this purpose.

/**
 * This structure describes the invite session.

 * Note regarding the invite session's pools. The inv_sess used to have
 * only one pool, which is just a pointer to the dialog's pool. Ticket
 * http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/877 has found that the memory
 * usage will grow considerably everytime re-INVITE or UPDATE is
 * performed.
 *
 * Ticket #877 then created two more memory pools for the inv_sess, so
 * now we have three memory pools:
 *  - pool: to be used to allocate long term data for the session
 *  - pool_prov and pool_active: this is a flip-flop pools to be used
 *     interchangably during re-INVITE and UPDATE. pool_prov is
 *     "provisional" pool, used to allocate SDP offer or answer for
 *     the re-INVITE and UPDATE. Once SDP negotiation is done, the
 *     provisional pool will be made as the active pool, then the
 *     existing active pool will be reset, to release the memory
 *     back to the OS. So these pool's lifetime is synchronized to
 *     the SDP offer-answer negotiation.
 *
 * Higher level application such as PJSUA-LIB has been modified to
 * make use of these flip-flop pools, i.e. by creating media objects
 * from the provisional pool rather than from the long term pool.
 *
 * Other applications that want to use these pools must understand
 * that the flip-flop pool's lifetimes are synchronized to the
 * SDP offer-answer negotiation.
 *
 * The lifetime of this session is controlled by the reference counter in this
 * structure, which is manipulated by calling #pjsip_inv_add_ref and
 * #pjsip_inv_dec_ref. When the reference counter has reached zero, then
 * this session will be destroyed.
